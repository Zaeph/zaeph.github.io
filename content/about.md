Hello there!

My name is **Leo Vivier**, and I’m an English teacher in France.

I’ve created this blog to **practise writing** on my topics of interests because it’s something that I find intimidating, even though I’m eager to share my discoveries.  I’m specialised in _Literature_ and _Media/Visual Studies_, but I love to dabble in other fields and experiment (I’m especially fond of _General Linguistics_, _Philosophy_, and _History_).

I intend to write on my **academic topics**, but I’d also love to write about the **Free Softwares** that I use to keep myself organised (e.g. _Emacs_, _org-mode_, _Zotero_, etc.).

I’ve _just_ started this blog, so it might take me some time to get the ball rolling, but I hope you’ll be able to find something you like!
